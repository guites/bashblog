# guites bashblog

My modified version of cfenollosa's [bashblog](https://github.com/cfenollosa/bashblog).

I'm keeping this to implement features not yet merged upstream, and remove some unused features in order to keep the core script smaller for better tinkering.

## Features

- Remove .html extension from list of tags ([9a0d24e](https://github.com/guites/bashblog/commit/9a0d24e749915a73214aa3350ecfc48c3188760c))
- Automatically generate a sitemaps file ([9a0d24e7499](https://github.com/guites/bashblog/commit/9a0d24e749915a73214aa3350ecfc48c3188760c))
- Keep posts original timestamp when managing different clones from the repository ([845acba](https://github.com/guites/bashblog/commit/845acbadf4abd32aa3fbdb271b796db56cfa3069))
